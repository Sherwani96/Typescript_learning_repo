//  synchronous code runs one line at a time
//  asynchronous code runs multiple lines
// async program wait for the response if response completed it will execute the line, while during waiting it executes the rest of the code

// synchronous program follows the execution order, like line by line
// while aschronous program, doesn't follow the execution order
