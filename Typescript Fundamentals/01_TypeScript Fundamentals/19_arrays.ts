// arrays are used to huge amount of data
// arrays can store any amount of data
// small pieces of data in an array are called elements
// elemnets in array of same data type can be added together
// but elements of different data types can not be added together, it cause the program to crash
// to add an element into the array we use push method of array
// to remove an element from the array we use pop method of array
// we can also use splice method
